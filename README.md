# Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp

Welcome to my comprehensive Data Science learning repository! 📊

This project documents my journey from the fundamentals of **Statistics and Probability** to building advanced **Machine Learning models**. It serves as both a theoretical archive and a practical portfolio, demonstrating my ability to handle data pipelines from scratch.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main sections to separate theory from practice:

### 1. [Courses & Theory](./Courses)
> *Foundations, Algorithms, and Mathematics.*
This section contains theoretical notes and algorithms implemented from scratch. It covers:
* **Statistics & Probability:** Distributions, Central Limit Theorem, Hypothesis Testing.
* **Regression Analysis:** Linear & Logistic Regression logic and math.

### 2. [Examples & Projects](./Examples)
> *Real-world Applications and Hands-on Labs.*
This section contains practical mini-projects and data analysis notebooks. It covers:
* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, filtering, and feature engineering with **Pandas**.
* **Visualization:** Insightful charts using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
* **Modeling:** Building predictive models using **Scikit-Learn**.

## Note on Datasets
To maintain a lightweight repository, large datasets (`.csv` files) are not hosted here. Please refer to the inner README files for instructions on how to obtain the necessary data for the examples.
